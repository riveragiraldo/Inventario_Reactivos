OmegaConf is a hierarchical configuration system, with support for merging configurations from multiple sources (YAML config files, dataclasses/objects and CLI arguments)
providing a consistent API regardless of how the configuration was created.

## Releases
### Release candidate (2.0)
OmegaConf 2.0 is coming, this is a real release candidate and you should feel free to use it.
Ths reason that this is still marked as release candidate is that this is a very big release and I want it to see some more use before officially releasing it.
No additional changes are planned for 2.0, please report any issues.
